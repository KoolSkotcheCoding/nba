## Description
The purpose of this project is to develop tools for analyzing the NBA’s player movement data. While the techniques underlying the tools will be based in typical math/statistics, the goal of this project is to provide novel baseketball analysis. That is, describing/quantifying things like ball movement, player movement, team movement and their effect on various outcomes (outcomes relating to possession, game, injury, individual statistics, etc.). 

In addition to analytical tools, this project also includes visualization methods. Currently 3D plotting/animation is supported along with the ability to export to MP4 video. 


## Background
The NBA, in collaboration with Sports VU, has released an API for retrieving the player movement data. **Note, as of 6/25/2016 the NBA was reporting technical issues with the API and no data could be retrieved. However, neilmj has created a repository containing the first half of the 2015-2016 season (https://github.com/neilmj/BasketballData). I plan to move a few games into this project for example/testing purposes.** This project was inspired by the ipython notebook created by Savvas Tjortjoglou (http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-play-by-play-movements.html).
